# clj-itext

The iText API is extremely painful. This is an effort to make it less so by wrapping the Java bindings in more friendly interfaces.

Features:
 - Simplified PdfReader instance generation
 - ...more coming soon...

## Example Usage

``(pdf<- "/path/to/sample.pdf")``

returns a ``PdfReader`` instance with the following metadata:
 - ``:bookmarks``
 - ``:pagecount``
 - ``:filename``

Using metadata removes the need to write extra code in your application to get this information. It can be accessed via ``meta``, e.g. ``(meta (pdf<- "/path/to/sample.pdf"))``.

## To Do

- Smooth out ``PdfWriter`` instantiation & interaction (this is the hairiest wart on the iText API, IMO)
- Other human-friendly improvements to the API as they come up.
